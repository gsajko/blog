## Intro
This is an introductory post about the project I'm making.
I'm in process of reading [Machine Learning Bookcamp Book](https://www.manning.com/books/machine-learning-bookcamp) by [Alexey Grigorev](https://twitter.com/Al_Grigor). The main "meta" concept behind this book is the idea, that the best way to learn Machine Learning is by doing projects.

In parallel, I follow [Applied ML](https://madewithml.com/#applied-ml) course by [Goku Mohandas](https://twitter.com/GokuMohandas). 

I will try to incorporate things I learn from both of those sources while doing this project.

For this post I'll be loosely using framework proposed [here](https://madewithml.com/courses/applied-ml/solution/)

## The Problem: Attention is scarce and Twitter feed sucks.

### Attention is scarce 
Common thinking about attention is, that we use our attention to consume information.

I like how Herbert A. Simon in [Designing organizations for an information-rich world](https://digitalcollections.library.cmu.edu/awweb/awarchive?type=file&item=33748) reverses this:

We're not consuming information, **information is consuming our attention**.

>Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.

That means, that **attention is scarce**. We should be really mindful about where we allocate our attention. At the sane time Internet media are overflowing with information.

### How to deal with this?
#### Reduce information overload
We can reduce information overload, by filtering out information that is not  relevant for us.

#### Focus on what matters most.
This can be different from person to person. But this need to comes from that personal deep values. 

I like Cal Newport's "The Minimalist Technology Screen" approach (from his book [Digital Minimalism](https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/)) 

>To allow an optional technology back into your life at the end of the digital declutter, it must:
>1. Serve something you deeply value (offering some benefit is not enough).
>2. Be the best way to use technology to serve this value (if it‚Äôs not, replace it with something better).
>3. Have a role in your life that is constrained with a standard operating procedure that specifies when and how you use it.


### Twitter feed sucks
I use Twitter a lot, so based on the premise that "attention is scarce", I don't find it useful.

I have to admit, that twitter newsfeed is good at recommencing me tweets (and putting them high on my newsfeed), that are interesting for me. This is even more visible, when I don't visit "Home" tab for a long time. If you refresh you newsfeed every 5 minutes it becomes worse immidetly. 
But at the same time, it floods me with unrelated stuff trying to drive my engagement even more - suggest me "topics to follow", and also recommends tweets related to outrage-of-the-day, suggest viral tweets. It just adds to the noise.
Muted words doesn't work for me as intended.
Twitter is good as a entertainment. Not as a source of information. 


##  Personal curiosity
Aside of "solving" this problem, there are several other reasons, why I'm interested in doing this.

### personal computation
I'm fascinated about ideas around "personal computation" where users control they own data, and algorithms that they use everyday. With this project I wanted to learn more about this, about challenges that are to be faced when trying to serve models locally, and how to train them with small about of data.

### learning about recsys
At the same time, I want to learn more about using RecSys in "real life" settings, and learn how to improve them with time.

### software engineering
This project is also my first attempt to have project existing outside of Jupyter Notebooks - with linting, Unit Tests, Makefile etc (as show here üëâ [How to Set Up a Python Project For Automation and Collaboration](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/setting-up-python-project-for-automation-and-collaboration/))


## Solution
Based [Applied ML](https://madewithml.com/#applied-ml) course - we need to first visualize solution, understand the problem, and design a baseline.

### Visualize an **ideal solution**
#### Custom twitter feed

### Understand

Chart used in this [tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/GruPiotr/status/1330507931549306882) is great at showcasing how the relevance of information can differ.

I want to get rid of all  information represented by "blue" curves, and most represented by "green" curves.
