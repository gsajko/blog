### On creativity
[John Cleese about creativity](https://speakola.com/arts/john-cleese-creativity-lecture-1991)
It's imporant to be in "Open mode" - not thinking directly about problem, and:

> [...] only other requirement is that you keep mind gently 'round the subject you're pondering.
>You'll daydream, of course, but you just keep bringing your mind back, just like with meditation. Because, and this is the extraordinary thing about creativity, if you just keep your mind resting against the subject in a friendly but persistent way, sooner or later you will get a reward from your unconscious, probably in the shower later. Or at breakfast the next morning, but suddenly you are rewarded, out of the blue a new thought mysteriously appears.

### Starvedub Subconscious 
In similar way R. Hamming in [You and Your Research](http://www.people.vcu.edu/~btmcinnes/lab/hamming.html) writes about harnessing subconsious:

>If you are deeply immersed and committed to a topic, day after day after day, your subconscious has nothing to do but work on your problem. And so you wake up one morning, or on some afternoon, and there's the answer. For those who don't get committed to their current problem, the subconscious goofs off on other things and doesn't produce the big result. So the way to manage yourself is that when you have a real important problem you don't let anything else get the center of your attention Â­ you keep your thoughts on the problem. **Keep your subconscious starved** so it has to work on _your_ problem, so you can sleep peacefully and get the answer in the morning, free.

And how to keep you subconsious starved?

### Implement content diet.

### What I don't like about term "Information diet".
I like this metaphor, but you can't live without eating. You can starve yourself to death.
There is no such a thing when it comes to "information diet".
For example:

You can just stop consuming. Full stop. 

I was on 10 days vipasanna silent retreat, and I can assure you, you won't die from lack of content consumption (we still had to eat).

That being said, there are also fun takes about it:

And it's helpful for thinking about HOW TO do content diet.
