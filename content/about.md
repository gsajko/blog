**Hi, I'm Grzegorz Sajko.**
I'm curious about attention economy and on personal level in interplays between distractions and focus.

Careerwise I want to move from a non-technical role into a data-related one.

So far I was learning Machine Learning with a hobbyist approach - I'm familiar with basics (Andrew Ng courses, fastai courses, NLP, stats, I'm comfortable reading papers).

Embracing the [Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) strategy, I'll be documenting my learning notes, project notes, in this blog.


## what I do?
- [coding](https://github.com/gsajko/)
- [writing](/posts/)
- [building](/projects/)
