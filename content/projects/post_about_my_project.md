## Intro
This is an introductory post about the project I'm making.
I'm in process of reading [Machine Learning Bookcamp Book](https://www.manning.com/books/machine-learning-bookcamp) by [Alexey Grigorev](https://twitter.com/Al_Grigor). The main "meta" concept behind this book is the idea, that the best way to learn Machine Learning is by doing projects.

In parallel, I follow [Applied ML](https://madewithml.com/#applied-ml) course by [Goku Mohandas](https://twitter.com/GokuMohandas). 

I will try to incorporate things I learn from both of those sources while doing this project.

For this post I'll be loosely using framework proposed [here](https://madewithml.com/courses/applied-ml/solution/)

## The Probem

### Attention is scarce
[
I like how Herbert A. Simon in Designing organizations for an information-rich world](https://digitalcollections.library.cmu.edu/awweb/awarchive?type=file&item=33748) reverses this:

We're not consuming information, **information is consuming our attention**.

>Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.

That means, that **attention is scarce**.

### How to deal with this?
#### Reduce information overload
We can reduce infromation overload, by filtering out unrealevant informations.


#### one why of dealing with this - filtering

### short mentions
#### fast food and fast information
#### personal computation
#### learning about recsys

## Solution

### Visualize
Visualize an **ideal solution** to our problem without factoring in constraints
#### Twitter assistant
